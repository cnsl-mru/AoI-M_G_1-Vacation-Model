# AoI-Vacation-Model
 Age of Information in Multi-Source Updating Systems: An M/G/1 Vacation Queueing Model


Abstract: Concurrent with the rise of real-time wireless systems enabled by the Internet of Things, the age of information (AoI) has
been widely perceived as a crucial destination-centric performance metric to quantify the timeliness of data delivery. This paper deals
with the analysis of information freshness in a multi-source M/G/1 queueing system with utilization of idle server time, referred to
as server vacation, in an effective manner. In particular, the status update packets in our model are generated independently by a finite
set of source nodes and according to a Poisson process, while their service time follows a general random variable. Using stochastic
decomposition and the Laplace-Stieltjes transform, we derive the average AoI(AAoI) expression for the multi-source M/G/1 queueing
model with generally-distributed vacation time in closed form. Our numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the derived AAoI
expression and assess the impact of different parameters on the system performance.
